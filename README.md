## Installation

### 1. Install or update Rust

curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# On Windows, download and run rustup-init.exe
# from https://rustup.rs instead

rustup update nightly

```

### 2. Clone this workshop

Clone your copy of the workshop codebase 

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/utxo-workshop.git
```

## UI Demo

In this UI demo, you will interact with the UTXO blockchain via the [Polkadot UI](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/development/front-end/polkadot-js). 

The following demo takes you through a scenario where: 
- Alice already owns a UTXO of value 100 upon genesis
- Alice sends Bob a UTXO with value 50, tipping the remainder to validators

1. Compile and build a release in dev mode
```
# Initialize your Wasm Build environment:
./scripts/init.sh

# Build Wasm and native code:
cargo build --release
```

2. Start your node & start producing blocks:
```zsh
./target/release/utxo-workshop --dev

# If you already modified state, run this to purge the chain
./target/release/utxo-workshop purge-chain --dev
```

3. In the console, notice the helper printouts. In particular, notice the default account `Alice` was already has `100 UTXO` upon the genesis block.

4. Open [Polkadot JS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings), making sure the client is connected to your local node by going to Settings > General, and selecting `Local Node` in the `remote node` dropdown.

5. **Declare the custom datatypes in PolkadotJS**, since the JS client cannot authomatically infer this from the UTXO module. Go to Settings > Developer tab and paste in the following JSON:

```json
{
  "Value": "u128",
  "TransactionInput": {
    "outpoint": "Hash",
    "sigscript": "Hash"
  },
  "TransactionOutput": {
    "value": "Value",
    "pubkey": "Hash"
  },
  "Transaction": {
    "inputs": "Vec<TransactionInput>",
    "outputs": "Vec<TransactionOutput>"
  }
}
```

6. **Check that Alice already has 100 UTXO at genesis**. In `Chain State` > `Storage`, select `utxoModule`. Input the hash `0x76584168d10a20084082ed80ec71e2a783abbb8dd6eb9d4893b089228498e9ff`. Click the `+` notation to query blockchain state.

    Notice that: 
    - This UTXO has a value of `100`
    - This UTXO belongs to Alice's pubkey. You use the [subkey](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/next/development/tools/subkey#well-known-keys) tool to confirm that the pubkey indeed belongs to Alice

7. **Spend Alice's UTXO, giving 50 to Bob.** In the `Extrinsics` tab, invoke the `spend` function from the `utxoModule`, using Alice as the transaction sender. Use the following input parameters:

    - outpoint: `0x76584168d10a20084082ed80ec71e2a783abbb8dd6eb9d4893b089228498e9ff`
    - sigscript: `0x6ceab99702c60b111c12c2867679c5555c00dcd4d6ab40efa01e3a65083bfb6c6f5c1ed3356d7141ec61894153b8ba7fb413bf1e990ed99ff6dee5da1b24fd83`
    - value: `50`
    - pubkey: `0x8eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693c912909cb226aa4794f26a48`

    Send this as an `unsigned` transaction. With UTXO blockchains, the proof is already in the `sigscript` input.

8. **Verify that your transaction succeeded**. In `Chain State`, look up the newly created UTXO hash: `0xdbc75ab8ee9b83dcbcea4695f9c42754d94e92c3c397d63b1bc627c2a2ef94e6` to verify that a new UTXO of 50, belonging to Bob, now exists! Also you can verify that Alice's original UTXO has been spent and no longer exists in UtxoStore.

*Coming soon: A video walkthrough of the above demo.*

## Beginner Workshop
**Estimated time**: 2 hours

In this workshop, you will: 
- Get familiar with basic Rust and Substrate functionality
- Prevent malicious users from sending bad UTXO transactions

Your challenge is to fix the code such that: 
1. The Rust compiler compiles without errors
2. All tests in `utxo.rs` pass, ensuring secure transactions

### Directions
1. Checkout the `workshop` branch. The `Master` branch has the solutions, so don't peek!

```zsh
git fetch origin workshop:workshop
git checkout workshop
```

2. Cd into the base directory. Try running the test with: `cargo test -p utxo-runtime`.

```zsh
compiling utxo-runtime v2.0.0 (/Users/nicole/Desktop/utxo-workshop/runtime)
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared type or module `H512`
   --> /Users/nicole/Desktop/utxo-workshop/runtime/src/utxo.rs:236:31
    |
236 |             input.sigscript = H512::zero();
    |                               ^^^^ use of undeclared type or module `H512`

...
```

3. Your first task: fix all the compiler errors! Hint: Look for the `TODO` comments in `utxo.rs` to see where to fix errors. 

4. Once your code compiles, it's now time to fix the `8` failing tests!

```zsh
failures:
    utxo::tests::attack_by_double_counting_input
    utxo::tests::attack_by_double_generating_output
    utxo::tests::attack_by_over_spending
    utxo::tests::attack_by_overflowing_value
    utxo::tests::attack_by_permanently_sinking_outputs
    utxo::tests::attack_with_empty_transactions
    utxo::tests::attack_with_invalid_signature
    utxo::tests::test_simple_transaction
```

5. In `utxo.rs`, edit the logic in `check_transaction()` function to make all tests pass.

```zsh
running 9 tests
test utxo::tests::attack_by_overflowing_value ... ok
test utxo::tests::attack_by_double_counting_input ... ok
test utxo::tests::attack_by_double_generating_output ... ok
test utxo::tests::attack_by_over_spending ... ok
test utxo::tests::attack_with_empty_transactions ... ok
test utxo::tests::attack_with_invalid_signature ... ok
test utxo::tests::attack_by_permanently_sinking_outputs ... ok
test utxo::tests::test_simple_transaction ... ok
```
