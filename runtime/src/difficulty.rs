//! A difficuty adjustment algorithm (DAA) to keep the block time close to a particular goal
//! Cribbed from Kulupu https://github.com/kulupu/kulupu/blob/master/runtime/src/difficulty.rs
//!
//! It is possible to implement other DAAs such as that of BTC and BCH. This would be an interesting
//! and worth-while experiment. The DAAs should be abstracted away with a trait.
//! Some ideas: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3410460
